	/**
	Enables the **failsafe** feature for the channel, with a given **failsafe time**.

	The **failsafe** feature is intended for use in applications where it is important for the channel to enter a known _safe state_ if the program controlling it locks up or crashes. If you do not enable the failsafe feature, the channel will carry out whatever instructions it was last given until it is explicitly told to stop.

	Enabling the failsafe feature starts a recurring **failsafe timer** for the channel. Once the failsafe timer is enabled, it must be reset within the specified time or the channel will enter a **failsafe state**. The failsafe timer may be reset either by calling this function again, or using the `ResetFailsafe` function. Resetting the failsafe timer will reload the timer with the specified _failsafe time_, starting when the message to reset the timer is received by the Phidget.

	For example: if the failsafe is enabled with a **failsafe time** of 1000ms, you will have 1000ms to reset the failsafe timer. Every time the failsafe timer is reset, you will have 1000ms from that time to reset the failsafe again.

	If the failsafe timer is not reset before it runs out, the channel will enter a **failsafe state**. For BLDC Motor channels, this will set the Target Velocity to 0. Once the channel enters the **failsafe state**, it will reject any further input until the channel is reopened.

	To prevent the channel from falsely entering the failsafe state, we recommend resetting the failsafe timer as frequently as is practical for your applicaiton. A good rule of thumb is to not let more than a third of the failsafe time pass before resetting the timer.

	Once the failsafe timer has been set, it cannot be disabled by any means other than closing and reopening the channel.

	The most recent position value will be reported in this event, which occurs when the `DataInterval` has elapsed.

	*   Regardless of the `DataInterval`, this event will occur only when the position value has changed from the previous value reported.
	*   Position values are calculated using Hall Effect sensors mounted on the motor, therefore, the resolution of position depends on the motor you are using.
	*   Units for `Position` can be set by the user through the `RescaleFactor`. The `RescaleFactor` allows you to use more intuitive units such as rotations, or degrees. For more information on how to apply the `RescaleFactor` to your application, see your controller's User Guide.
